            <h1> Introduction to Artificial Intelligence</h1>

            Artificial
            Intelligence
            is the ability to design smart machines or to develop self-learning software applications that imitate the
            traits of the human mind like reasoning, problem-solving, planning, optimal decision making, sensory
            perceptions
            etc. The capacity of artificial intelligent approaches to outperform human actions in terms of knowledge
            discovery gained the attention of business and research communities all over the world, and this field of
            study
            witnessed rapid progress in the past two decades.
            <br> <br>
        
        <div>
            <h2> &bullet; Main Components and Characteristics of AI</h2>
            Given below are the components or frameworks that majorly contribute towards the implementation of various
            intelligent systems as follows: <br>

           &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  1. Deep Learning
            Deep learning architecture has more hidden layers between the input and output layers when compared to that
            of
            artificial neural networks. This architectural change facilitates the deep learning framework to perform
            automatic feature extraction along with classification learning. These models employ supervised learning to
            train with well-labeled datasets. Despite inherent complexity in the architecture with numerous hidden
            layers,
            the learning time of the model can be drastically reduced with the usage of high-performance
            parallel-computing
            GPUs.
        </div> <br> 
        <div>
            <h2>&bullet; Application of AI:</h2>
            So now we are discussing the theories and methods related to AI revolutionized all fields, including Retail,
            Finance, Space research, Healthcare, Consumer Electronics, Automobiles, etc.
            The details for a few applications are as below: <br> <div class="black">

            &emsp14;&emsp14;&emsp14;&emsp14;&emsp14;&emsp14;&emsp14;&emsp14;&emsp14;&emsp14;&emsp14; 1. Ethical Gene Editing:
            The notion of personalized medical care to treat diseases or disorders caused due to gene mutations is
            achieved
            by precisely understanding the genetic blueprint of the patient. The analysis to identify the order of
            nucleotides is called Genome Sequencing. With the insights from Genome sequencing, susceptible mutations
            would
            be identified to prescribe a sufferer-specific line of treatment. <br>&emsp14;&emsp14;&emsp14;&emsp14;&emsp14;&emsp14;&emsp14;&emsp14;&emsp14;&emsp14;&emsp14;
<img src="/deep l.jpg" alt="">
            2. Intelligent Disaster Response System:
            Modern rescue systems use AI-powered drones, robots, sensors to quickly gather precise information regarding
            the
            extent of damage, the exact location of trapped victims, topographical details of the landscape during
            crisis
            times. Intelligent systems assist rescue workers to identify the nearest and safest assemble points while
            evacuating people from disaster-hit areas. AI-equipped disaster management modules effectively stimulate
            mock
            disaster drills to identify potentially vulnerable locations, plan precautionary actions, to monitor and
            govern
            resource allocation seamlessly. <br>&emsp14;&emsp14;&emsp14;&emsp14;&emsp14;&emsp14;&emsp14;&emsp14;&emsp14;&emsp14;&emsp14;

            3. Recommendation Systems:
            The best recommendation systems identify or predict users’ preferences to items based on items’ profiles and
            inferences about users behaviour. The willingness of users towards various items is represented as user-item
            pairs in the utility matrix.
            <br> <br>
            <h2> &bullet;Advantages of Artificial Intelligence</h2>
            Given below are the advantages of artificial intelligence: <br>

            1.Minimal Human Intervention: AI-powered systems are the best-fit solutions in environments where human life
            is
            more likely to be at risk. Few examples of such scenarios are space exploration, defense operations like
            bomb
            defusing, workplaces characterized by intense heat, Mineral mining, etc. <br>
            2.Faster and Accurate: The performance of well-trained AI-enabled applications drastically reduces the
            chance
            for human errors to creep in. These AI versions proved to be faster at computationally expensive tasks,
            especially in the field of scientific research and at time-consuming tasks. Most of the routine, trivial and
            repetitive tasks can be automated with proper AI drove the technology to improve operational efficiencies.

            <h2> &bullet;Challanges:</h2>
            <img src="/ai image.jpg" alt=""> 
            1. Need for Massive Data Corpus:
            In general, intelligent systems, before getting deployed as a real-world solution, learn an optimized model
            with
            the help of a large amount of data while training and validation. The availability of huge data volumes and
            the
            ability to handle them are the major limitations for the conventional systems and software applications to
            evolve as AI-enabled editions. The need for sophisticated modeling techniques that can estimate the model
            parameters with high precision using limited data samples is imminent. <br> 

            2. Multimodal Interactions:
            The efficiency and precision of perception-based recognition applications that encompass computer-vision
            methods
            can be improved by leveraging the ability to interpret and process multiple modes of data simultaneously.
            This
            enables the recognition paradigm to ideally emulate human intelligence that works in conjunction with
            various
            senses like touch, vision, hearing, etc. <br>

            3. Beyond Human Control:
            With the exceptional capability of AI technology to understand and learn vast libraries of information at a
            faster pace, there are few threatening instances where an AI framework gained an emotional quotient and
            surpassed the extremities of human logical thinking. In such unregulated cases, the unusual behavior of AI
            systems would lead to irreparable catastrophe
    <br> <br>
       
            <h2> &bullet; Introduction to Types of Artificial Intelligence</h2>

            The following article provides an outline for the most important type of Artificial Intelligence. The main
            aim
            of Artificial Intelligence aim is to enable machines to perform a human-like function. Thus the primary way
            of
            classification of AI is based on how well it is able to replicate human-like actions. AI can, by and large,
            be
            classified based on two types, both of which are based on its ability to replicate the human brain. One type
            of
            classification, which is “Based on Functionality”, classify AI on the basis of their likeness to the human
            mind
            and their ability to think and feel like humans. The second way of classification is more prominent in the
            tech
            industry, which is” Based on Capabilities” of AI vis-à-vis Human Intelligence. <br> <br>

            <h2> &bullet; Types of Artificial Intellegence </h2>
            There are mainly two types of AI which are based on Functionality & Capabilities:
<br>

            &starf; Type 1 – Based on Functionality:
<br>
&emsp14;&emsp14;&emsp14;&emsp14;&emsp14;&emsp14;&emsp14;&emsp14;&emsp14;&emsp14;&emsp14;1. Reactive Machine:
            They are the most basic and oldest type of Artificial Intelligence. They replicate a human’s ability to
            react to
            different kinds of stimuli. This type of AI has no memory power, so they lack the capability to use
            previously
            gained information/experience to obtain better results. Therefore, these kinds of AI don’t have the ability
            to
            train themselves like the ones we come across nowadays.

            Example: Deep Blue, IBM’s chess-playing supercomputer, is the perfect example of these kinds of machines. It
            is
            famous for defeating international grandmaster Garry Kasparov in the late 1990s. Deep Blue can identify
            different pieces in the chessboard and how each moves. It can identify all the possible legal moves for
            itself
            and its opponents. Based on the option, it selects the best possible move. However, it doesn’t have the
            ability
            to learn from its past moves as these machines don’t have any memory of their own. <br>
<img src="/Ai Hand.jpg" alt="">
            &emsp14;&emsp14;&emsp14;&emsp14;&emsp14;&emsp14;&emsp14;&emsp14;&emsp14;&emsp14;&emsp14; 2. Limited Theory:
            This type of AI, along with the ability of Reactive Machines, have memory capabilities so they can use past
            information/experience to make better future decisions. Most of the common applications existing around us
            fall
            under this category. These AI applications can be trained by a large volume of training data they store in
            their
            memory in a reference model.

            Example: Limited Memory technology is used in many self-driving cars use. They store data like GPS location,
            speed of nearby cars, size /nature of obstructions, among a hundred other kinds of data to drive just like a
            human does.
<br>&emsp14;&emsp14;&emsp14;&emsp14;&emsp14;&emsp14;&emsp14;&emsp14;&emsp14;&emsp14;&emsp14;

            3. Theory of Mind:
            Theory of Mind is the next level of AI, which has very limited to no presence in our day-to-day lives. These
            kind of AI are mostly in the “Work in Progress” stage and are usually confined to research labs. These kinds
            of
            AI, once developed, will have a very deep understating of human minds ranging from their needs, likes,
            emotions,
            thought process, etc. Basis their understanding of Human minds and their whims, the AI will be able to alter
            its
            own response.

            Example: Researcher Winston in his research, showed a prototype of a robot that can walk down the small
            corridor
            with other robots coming from the opposite direction; the AI can foresee other robots movements and can turn
            right, left or any other way so as to avoid a possible collision with the incoming robots. As per Wilson,
            this
            Robot determines its action based on its “common sense” of how other robots will move. <br> &emsp14;&emsp14;&emsp14;&emsp14;&emsp14;&emsp14;&emsp14;&emsp14;&emsp14;&emsp14;&emsp14;

            4. Self-Aware AI:
            This is the final stage of AI. Its current existence is only hypothetical and can be found only in Science
            fiction movies. These kinds of AI can understand and evoke human emotions and have emotions of their own.
            These
            kind of AI are decades, if not centuries, away from materializing. It is this kind of AI which AI skeptics
            like
            Elon Musk are wary of. This is because once it is self-aware, the AI can get into Self-Preservation mode; it
            might consider humanity as a potential threat and may directly or indirectly pursue endeavor to end
            humanity.
<br> <br>
            <h2> Type 2 – Based on Capabilities</h2>

            1. Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI):
            All the existing AI applications which we see around us falls under this category. ANI includes an AI system
            that can perform narrowly defined specific tasks just like humans. However these machines cannot perform
            tasks
            for which it was not programmed before-hand, so they fail at performing an unprecedented task. Based on the
            classification mentioned above, this system is a combination of all reactive and limited memory AI. AI
            algorithms that we use in today’s world to perform the most complex Prediction Modelling fall under this
            category of AI.
<br>
            2. Artificial General Intelligence (ANI)
            AGI has the capability to train, learn, understand and perform functions just like a normal human does.
            These
            systems will have multi-functional capabilities cutting across different domains. These systems will be more
            agile and will react and improvise just like humans while facing unprecedented scenarios. There is no
            real-world
            example of this kind of AI, but a good amount of progress has been made in this field
<br>
            3. Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI)
            Artificial Super Intelligence will be the top-most point of AI development. ASI will be the most potent form
            of
            intelligence to ever exist on this planet. It will be able to perform all the tasks better than humans
            because
            of its inordinately superior data processing, memory, and decision-making ability. Some of the researchers
            fear
            that the advent of ASI will ultimately result in “Technological Singularity”. It is a hypothetical situation
            in
            which the growth in technology will reach an uncontrollable stage, resulting in an unimaginable change in
            Human
            Civilization.

            At present, it is very hard to foresee how our future will look like when a more dexterous form of AI
            materializes. However, with great certainty, we are still a long distance apart to reach that stage as we
            are
            just in the very nascent stage of the development of advanced AI. For the proponents of AI, we can say that
            we
            are just scratching the surface to unearth the true potential of AI, and for the AI skeptics, it is too soon
            to
            get chills about Technological Singularity.

       <br> <br>

            <h2> &bullet; Examples Of Making AI </h2>

            Most of the programming languages used in AI are as follows.

            Python is unique and most favorite for computer programmers because of its syntax, which is simple and
            versatile. It is very comfortable and applied in all OS like Unix, Linux, Windows, and Mac. As Python has a
            systematic arrangement, it is applied in OOPS, neural network, NLP development and various types of
            programming.
            It is so unique and has a wide variety of Library functions.

            C++ is applied mostly in AI programming tasks because of its time-sensitive feature. It has minimum response
            time and a quick execution process that is important for developing games and search engines. It is reusable
            because of its inheritance and data hiding properties. It is widely used to solve AI statistical techniques.

            Java is another mostly used AI programming language, and it does not need any special platform for
            recompilation
            because of Virtual Machine Technology. It combines the features of C and C++ and makes it more simple and
            easy
            to debug. In addition, the Automatic memory manager in Java reduces the work of the developer.

            LISP is used in part of AI development. LISP has a specific macro system that alleviates implementation and
            exploration of multiple levels of Intellectual Intelligence. It is mostly applied in solving logic tasks and
            Machine learning. It favours Liberty and fast prototyping to programmers and makes LISP as more standard
            language and User-friendly in AI.

            PROLOG is used for basic algorithm automatic backtracking, tree-based structuring and Pattern matching,
            which is
            mandatory for AI. In addition, it is extensively applied in medical science.
